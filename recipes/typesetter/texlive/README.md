# TeX Live (Typesetter)

Compiles LaTeX `.tex` documents to PDF with a full [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/)
installation and exposes the engine to TeXlyre over a local WebSocket compile
bridge.

The Docker image layers TeX Live full, Node, and the shared
[Chelys typesetter bridge](../../../bridge/1/README.md) with a LaTeX-specific
engine adapter (`engine.cjs`).

## latexmk drives the build

The adapter does not call the engine directly. It runs `latexmk`, which
orchestrates the full multi-pass build: it reruns the selected engine until
references and the table of contents stabilise, and invokes `biber`, `bibtex`,
and `makeindex` when the document needs them. The engine is chosen per compile
rather than per install, so the same container serves pdfLaTeX, LuaLaTeX,
XeLaTeX, pLaTeX, and upLaTeX.

pLaTeX and upLaTeX use the traditional Japanese DVI workflow: `latexmk` runs
`platex` or `uplatex`, then converts the resulting DVI to PDF with `dvipdfmx`.
Their automatic BibTeX and index steps use `pbibtex`/`mendex` or
`upbibtex`/`upmendex`, respectively. The full TeX Live image already contains
those programs, so no additional container packages are required.
## Bundled tools

The image is the full TeX Live scheme plus the external programs LaTeX packages
commonly shell out to:

- Pygments for `minted`
- Inkscape for `svg`
- gnuplot for `gnuplottex`
- Ghostscript and ImageMagick for image conversion
- a headless JRE for `asymptote`
- Noto fonts, including CJK and colour emoji

Shell escape is enabled by default so those packages work. Disable it from the
compile panel for untrusted documents.

## Modes

- **Docker** (recommended): builds an image containing TeX Live, the tools
  above, and the bridge.
- **Connect**: point TeXlyre at an existing bridge you run yourself.

## Variables

- `wsPort`: port the compile bridge listens on (default `7045`).

## Options

- **LaTeX Engine**: `pdflatex`, `lualatex`, `xelatex`, `platex`, or `uplatex`.
- **Bibliography**: `latexmk` auto-detects the right program; override to force
  Biber or BibTeX.
- **Shell escape**: passes `-shell-escape`. Required by minted, svg, and
  gnuplottex.
- **Include log file**: export the build log alongside the PDF.

## SyncTeX

`-synctex=1` is always passed, and the generated `.synctex.gz` is returned
beside the PDF as a downloadable artifact, which is what drives forward and
reverse search in the TeXlyre PDF viewer. This also applies to the pLaTeX and
upLaTeX DVI-to-PDF path.

## Incremental sync

`typeConfig.incrementalSync` is enabled. The bridge keeps a per-connection
working tree and reconciles it against the manifest TeXlyre sends with each
request, so only changed files are transferred after the first compile, and
`latexmk`'s auxiliary files survive between builds. The tree is discarded when
the socket closes or when TeXlyre requests a cache clear.
